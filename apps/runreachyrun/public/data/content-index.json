Turns out our standalone Gradio app architecture is fundamentally different from what the ecosystem expects.\n\n### Two Different Paradigms\n\n**What we built (Standalone):**\n[code block]\n\n**What Pollen expects (Dashboard Plugin):**\n[code block]\n\nThe key insight: apps in the Reachy Mini ecosystem are **plugins**, not standalone applications. The daemon manages robot connections. The dashboard manages app lifecycle. Your app just receives a connected robot and a stop signal.\n\n### The Refactor\n\nCreated new package structure in `apps/focus-guardian-hf/`:\n\n[code block]\n\nKey changes in `main.py`:\n1. Inherit from `ReachyMiniApp`\n2. Implement `run(reachy_mini, stop_event)` instead of `main()`\n3. Use the pre-initialized robot - don't call `get_robot()`\n4. Check `stop_event.is_set()` in main loop for clean shutdown\n5. Set `custom_app_url` to point to Gradio UI running in separate thread\n\n### Publishing Process\n\n[code block]\n\nResult: https://huggingface.co/spaces/RyeCatcher/focus-guardian\n\n### Not Submitted to Official Store Yet\n\nTo get listed in the official app store, need to run:\n[code block]\n\nThis creates a PR to `pollen-robotics/reachy-mini-official-app-store` dataset. Holding off until the app is more polished.\n\n### Documentation Created\n\nWrote `docs/publishing-reachy-apps.md` covering:\n- ReachyMiniApp pattern\n- Package structure\n- Publishing methods (Python API, Git, official assistant)\n- Common issues and solutions\n\n### Lessons Learned\n\n1. **Ecosystem integration requires architectural changes.** Can't just push a standalone app and expect it to work.\n\n2. **The dashboard is the control plane.** Apps are plugins that respond to start/stop signals. Robot connection is shared infrastructure.\n\n3. **custom_app_url bridges...", "metadata": {"date": "2025-12-21", "tags": ["hardware", "software", "claude-code", "focus-guardian", "huggingface", "infrastructure"], "slug": "publishing-to-huggingface-ecosystem", "url": "/journal/publishing-to-huggingface-ecosystem"}}, {"id": "journal-runreachyrun-com-initial-setup", "type": "journal", "title": "runreachyrun.com Initial Setup", "content": "**Duration:** ~45 minutes\n**Goal:** Set up the public documentation site for the Reachy build journey\n\n### Context\n\nWe need a place to share the Reachy Mini journey publicly. Not just a blog \u2014 a living documentation of every session, milestone, failure, and app. Something that captures the build-in-public spirit while being genuinely useful for others building with Reachy or working with Claude Code.\n\n### Design Exploration\n\nBrainstormed three distinct visual directions:\n\n**1. Transmission**\nSignal/waveform aesthetic. Dark with electric cyan. Data being decoded. Timeline as waveform with amplitude = significance. The robot is sending transmissions as it comes to life.\n\n**2. Exposed Circuitry**\nPCB traces, current flowing. Follow connections between ideas. Each node shows its wiring diagram. Technical, connected, systematic.\n\n**3. Dual Presence**\nTwo visible authors (human/AI). Warm colors for human decisions, cool for Claude suggestions. Revelation slider to see process behind any section.\n\n**Decision:** Transmission, content-first variant.\n\nWhy: The robot journey should be primary. The AI collaboration angle is interesting but risks overwhelming the actual content. People come to see the robot build, not to study human-AI workflows.

Woke up, plugged it in via USB, and asked Claude Code for help getting it running. What followed was a real-time debugging session that showcases how AI-assisted development actually works.\n\n---\n\n## The Problem: Stuck in Simulation Mode\n\nI had been running the Reachy Mini simulator the day before, building code and testing movements. When I connected the physical robot, the daemon was still configured for simulation mode (`--sim` flag). The robot was physically connected but the software wasn't talking to it.\n\n**What I said:** \"I built my Reachy light. Can you help me get it running?\"\n\n**What Claude did:**\n\n1. **Immediately checked USB detection:**\n[code block]\nResult: `/dev/cu.usbmodem5AF71342721` - the robot was detected!\n\n2. **Checked daemon status:**\n[code block]\nFound the daemon running with `--sim --headless` flags - simulation mode.\n\n3. **Diagnosed the issue:** The daemon was running in sim mode, not hardware mode.\n\n---\n\n## The Fix: Switching from Sim to Hardware\n\nClaude stopped the simulation daemon and started one for the physical robot:\n\n[code block]\n\n**First hiccup:** \"Device or resource busy\" error. The serial port was still locked from the previous daemon.\n\n**The fix:** Kill all processes, wait for port to release, try again.\n\n[code block]\n\n**Result:** Daemon started successfully, found the robot on `/dev/cu.usbmodem5AF71342721`, initialized all 9 motors.\n\n---\n\n## First Movement: Proof of Life\n\nClaude ran a test script to wiggle the antennas:\n\n[code block]\n\n**The moment:** Watching those antennas wiggle for the first time. Months of anticipation, reduced to a half-second of servo movement. It worked.\n\n---\n\n## CLI Control: Beyond the Desktop App\n\nThis is where it gets interesting for developers. You don't need the Reachy Mini Control desktop app to control the robot.

Different personalities for genres.\n\nWhy it's compelling: Transforms music listening into a shared experience. The robot isn't just a speaker - it's a physical visualization of sound with its own style.\n\n---\n\n### Architecture Overview\n\n[code block]\n\n**Key Components:**\n\n1. **AudioAnalyzer** (`audio_analyzer.py`)\n   - Uses `sounddevice` for real-time audio capture\n   - FFT for frequency band analysis (bass/mid/treble)\n   - Onset detection for beat tracking\n   - BPM estimation from beat intervals\n\n2. **MovementMapper** (`music_animations.py`)\n   - Maps audio features to robot movements\n   - Genre-specific presets define movement style\n   - Smoothing and randomization for natural motion\n\n3. **GenrePresets** (`config.py`)\n   - 7 distinct movement personalities\n   - Configurable: amplitude, speed, style, emphasis\n\n---\n\n### Genre Movement Styles\n\n| Genre | Head Bob | Body Sway | Antenna Style | Emphasis |\n|-------|----------|-----------|---------------|----------|\n| Rock | High (12mm) | Minimal | Dramatic flicks | Headbang |\n| EDM | Medium (10mm) | High rotation | Pulsing | Nod |\n| Jazz | Low (5mm) | Slow graceful | Gentle sway | Tilt |\n| Pop | Medium (8mm) | Moderate | Bouncy | Nod |\n| Classical | Very low (3mm) | Graceful arcs | Conductor | Tilt |\n| Hip-Hop | Medium (10mm) | Rhythmic | Attitude flicks | Freeze |\n| Chill | Low (4mm) | Slow peaceful | Gentle sway | Tilt |\n\nEach preset also defines:\n- Movement smoothing factor\n- Randomness/variation amount\n- Idle animation style\n\n---\n\n### Technical Decisions\n\n**Why sounddevice over PyAudio?**\n- More Pythonic API\n- Easier to install on macOS\n- Clean callback-based streaming\n\n**Why not use librosa for everything?**\n- librosa is designed for offline analysis\n- For real-time, we use simpler onset detection\n- BPM...", "metadata": {"date": "2025-12-20", "tags": ["hardware", "software", "claude-code", "camera", "audio", "simulation"], "slug": "building-dj-reactor-afternoon", "url": "/journal/building-dj-reactor-afternoon"}}, {"id": "blog-first-boot-with-claude", "type": "blog", "title": "First Boot: Debugging a Robot with an AI Pair Programmer", "content": "I built my Reachy Mini Lite overnight. Woke up at 6am, plugged it in via USB, and asked Claude Code for help getting it running. Forty-five minutes later, the robot was talking back to me.\n\nThis is the story of that debugging session. Not the polished \"and then it worked\" version. The actual sequence of problems, wrong turns, and the moments where having an AI read source code in real-time made the difference.\n\nI've [written about AI coding assistants before](https://rundatarun.io/p/a-deep-dive-into-ai-coding-assistants) and [compared Claude Code to other tools](https://rundatarun.io/p/the-battle-for-ai-powered-development). This is the first time I've used one for hardware debugging. The experience was different from software development in ways I didn't expect.\n\n## The Setup\n\nI'd been running the Reachy Mini in simulation mode for a week, building and testing apps. The simulator uses MuJoCo for physics, and the code works identically on hardware. In theory.\n\nThe physical robot arrived. I assembled it, connected via USB, and got nothing. Well, not nothing. The robot was detected. It just wasn't responding to commands.\n\n## Stuck in Simulation Mode\n\nThe daemon (the background service that manages robot communication) was still configured for simulation. I'd been running `--sim --headless` flags for a week. The robot was physically there, but the software wasn't talking to it.\n\nMy prompt was simple: \"I built my Reachy light. Can you help me get it running?\"\n\nClaude checked USB detection first:\n\n[code block]\n\nResult: `/dev/cu.usbmodem5AF71342721`. The robot was detected.\n\nThen daemon status:\n\n[code block]\n\nFound it running with `--sim --headless --fastapi-port 8000`. Simulation mode. The diagnosis was immediate: stop the sim daemon, start one for hardware.\n\n## Serial Port Locking\n\nClaude stopped the simulation daemon and tried to start the hardware daemon.
