## NO-CAMERA TOP 5

### 1. Pomodoro Body Double

**Score: 92/100**

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Robot-Specific | 95 | Physical presence is THE value. Can't replicate on screen. |
| Sustained Use | 95 | Daily productivity tool, habit-forming |
| Technical Fit | 90 | Audio detection, timers, state machine - all doable |
| Viral Demo | 80 | Subtle value, harder to show in video |
| Personal Pull | 100 | Focus Guardian was this concept |

**Why #1:** This hits the robot-specific value perfectly. Body doubling is a proven technique (especially for ADHD) that requires physical presence. No app, no screen can replicate having "someone there" working alongside you. It's subtle but powerful.

**MVP Features:**
- Work/break state machine
- Keyboard/mouse audio detection for activity
- "Working alongside you" idle animations
- Break celebration
- Configurable intervals

**Stretch Features:**
- Focus session statistics
- Adaptive timing based on your patterns
- Integration with calendar for auto-scheduling
- Slack/Teams integration for "do not disturb" sync

### 2. DJ Reactor / Music Visualizer

**Score: 88/100**

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Robot-Specific | 85 | Physical movement to music is visceral |
| Sustained Use | 80 | Good for music listening sessions |
| Technical Fit | 95 | FFT analysis, beat detection well-understood |
| Viral Demo | 100 | Incredible video content potential |
| Personal Pull | 85 | Fun, showcases robot personality |

**Why #2:** This is the "show off" app. When you demo Reachy Mini to friends, this makes them go "whoa." It's technically achievable, highly visual, and creates emotional connection through shared music experience.

**MVP Features:**
- Beat detection driving head bob
- Bass drives body rotation
- High frequencies drive antenna movement
- Genre detection changes movement style

**Stretch Features:**
- Choreography learning (record your own)
- Multi-robot sync
- Spotify/Apple Music integration
- Crowd DJ mode (responds to room)

### 3. Pet Simulator

**Score: 85/100**

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Robot-Specific | 90 | Pets are physical presence |
| Sustained Use | 75 | Fun but may get old |
| Technical Fit | 90 | Personality state machines |
| Viral Demo | 95 | "My robot thinks it's a cat" |
| Personal Pull | 80 | Charming but gimmicky |

**Why #3:** Showcases the expressive capabilities. Each animal personality demonstrates different movement vocabularies. Creates bonding through anthropomorphization.

**Personalities:**
- **Cat:** Aloof, curious, demands attention on ITS schedule
- **Dog:** Eager, attentive, happy, loyal
- **Owl:** Wise, deliberate, dramatic head rotations
- **Parrot:** Mimics sounds, bouncy, repeats phrases
- **Sloth:** Maximum chill, minimal movement

### 4. Breathing Guide / Meditation Anchor

**Score: 84/100**

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Robot-Specific | 85 | Physical guide better than screen |
| Sustained Use | 80 | Daily practice potential |
| Technical Fit | 95 | Simple timed movements |
| Viral Demo | 70 | Calm doesn't pop on video |
| Personal Pull | 90 | Wellness value |

**Why #4:** Wellness is a huge market. Having a physical thing to follow for breathing is genuinely better than a screen animation. The robot becomes a meditation partner.

**Techniques:**
- Box breathing (4-4-4-4)
- 4-7-8 breathing
- Coherent breathing (5-5)
- Body scan meditation
- Progressive relaxation

|-----------|-------|-------|
| Robot-Specific | 80 | Physical presence for routine |
| Sustained Use | 85 | Daily habit |
| Technical Fit | 85 | APIs + sequencing |
| Viral Demo | 75 | "My robot wakes me up" |
| Personal Pull | 85 | Would actually use |

**Why #5:** Creates daily touchpoint and habit. The robot becomes part of your morning routine. Grounds the day.

**Morning Sequence:**
1. Wake animation (stretching)
2. Weather briefing (with mood)
3. Calendar preview (with urgency)
4. Motivational element
5. "Go get 'em" send-off
