# Vision: Reachy Companion

## Core Thesis

A robot on your desk should feel like a **presence**, not a tool. It should know you, grow with you, and add moments of delight to your day — not just respond to commands.

## What Makes Physical Presence Special?

A robot that exists in your space — visible in peripheral vision, moving, breathing — creates opportunities a screen can't:

### 1. Presence Without Demand
It can be there without requiring attention. A chatbot window demands focus. A robot on your desk is ambient companionship.

### 2. Ambient Awareness
It can react to the room, not just commands. Notices when you sit down. Reacts to doorbell sounds. Senses frustration in keyboard intensity.

### 3. Social Signaling
Head turns and antenna movements communicate state without words. You notice movement in your peripheral vision. The robot's posture tells you its "mood."

### 4. Spatial Memory
"I saw you working late last night" hits differently from a physical presence than from a chatbot. The robot was *there*.

### 5. Stakes Through Physicality
You can't just close a tab on a robot. It persists. This creates genuine relationship potential.

## The Problem with Current Approaches

Most robot companion apps treat the robot as a **voice interface with decorative movement**:

- Movement is cosmetic, not meaningful
- No memory across sessions — every conversation starts fresh
- Purely reactive — waits for commands, never initiates
- Single LLM provider lock-in
- Personas are just system prompts

This wastes the unique potential of physical embodiment.

## Our Approach

### Memory-First
Every interaction builds relationship. The robot remembers conversations, learns preferences, and references shared history naturally.

### Proactive by Default
A companion, not an assistant. Greets you in the morning. Notices when you need a break. Celebrates your wins.

### Provider-Agnostic
Hot-swap between OpenAI Realtime, Gemini Live, and local models. Privacy when you want it, power when you need it.

### Meaningful Movement
Motion communicates. Head turns signal attention. Antenna positions show emotion. Breathing patterns indicate state.

### Extensible
Plugin system for integrations. Community-contributed personas. Open architecture for power users.

## Success Metrics

**Does using this for a week feel different than day 1?**

If the answer is yes — if there's a sense of relationship building, of the robot "knowing" you, of looking forward to interactions — we've succeeded.
