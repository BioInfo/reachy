# Viral Factors

What makes this shareable, memorable, and worth talking about?

---

## Core Insight

> People share **moments**, not features.

A feature list doesn't go viral. A video of a robot noticing you're frustrated and asking if you're okay does.

---

## High-Shareability Moments

### 1. Proactive Magic

**The moment:** Robot does something unexpected and delightful without being asked.

**Examples:**
- "I was debugging for 2 hours and my robot said 'Hey, you've been at this a while. Want to talk through the problem?'"
- "Walked in this morning and my robot said 'Good morning! You've got that big presentation at 2pm - want me to help you prep?'"
- "My build failed 5 times in a row and my robot did a little sad dance. Then when it finally passed, it celebrated with me."

**Why it works:** Surprise + emotional resonance + "this feels like the future"

---

### 2. Relationship Progression

**The moment:** Day 1 vs Day 100 comparison showing genuine relationship building.

**Content ideas:**
- Side-by-side videos: generic greeting vs personalized context-aware greeting
- "Things my robot remembers about me" thread
- "My robot referenced a conversation from 3 months ago"

**Why it works:** Demonstrates something chatbots don't do. Creates emotional investment narrative.

---

### 3. Persona Showcase

**The moment:** Wild/creative personas that are genuinely unique.

**Content ideas:**
- Anime character personas with matching voice and expressions
- Historical figures (Einstein explains your code)
- Gordon Ramsay roasts your git commits
- Meditation guru for focus sessions
- Hype man for celebrations

**Why it works:** Creativity + personality + "I want to make my own"

---

### 4. Unexpected Integrations

**The moment:** Robot knows something you didn't expect it to know.

**Examples:**
- "My robot told me about my PR approval before Slack notified me"
- "It dimmed my lights when I said 'starting a meeting'"
- "It noticed I was on a call and waited until I was done to tell me about my next meeting"

**Why it works:** Seamlessness feels magical. Integration = real utility.

---

### 5. Emotion & Expression

**The moment:** Robot expresses emotion in a way that feels genuine.

**Content ideas:**
- Slow-mo of emotional reactions (antenna droop when sad)
- Compilation of celebration dances
- "My robot looked disappointed when I cancelled our pomodoro"

**Why it works:** Anthropomorphization is powerful. Emotional design is memorable.

## The One-Liner Test

Can someone explain why this is cool in one sentence?

**Good:**
- "It's a robot that knows you and grows with you"
- "My robot celebrates when I ship code"
- "It's like having a companion, not an assistant"

**Bad:**
- "It's a multi-backend LLM interface for the Reachy Mini"
- "It has persistent memory and proactive behaviors"
- "You can customize personas with voice and movement"

Lead with emotion, follow with features.
